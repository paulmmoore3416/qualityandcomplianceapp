## Executive Summary

On February 2, 2026, the FDA's Quality Management System Regulation (QMSR) officially took effect, fundamentally changing how medical device manufacturers in the United States manage quality systems. The QMSR harmonizes 21 CFR Part 820 with ISO 13485:2016, replacing decades-old prescriptive requirements with a globally recognized, risk-based quality management framework.

This whitepaper examines the practical implications of this regulatory shift and demonstrates how MedTech Compliance Suite enables manufacturers to bridge the gap between legacy Part 820 compliance and the new ISO 13485-aligned requirements.

## 1. The Regulatory Landscape Has Changed

The FDA published the final QMSR rule on January 31, 2025 (90 FR 8112), with a compliance date of February 2, 2026. This rule:

- **Incorporates ISO 13485:2016 by reference** into the Code of Federal Regulations
- **Eliminates most prescriptive Part 820 requirements** in favor of ISO 13485's process-based approach
- **Retains certain FDA-specific requirements** including complaint files, MDR reporting, and records requirements
- **Harmonizes the US framework** with international quality system expectations

### Why This Matters Now

FDA inspectors conducting Quality System Inspections (QSIs) after February 2, 2026 will evaluate manufacturers against ISO 13485:2016 requirements rather than the legacy Part 820 subparts. Manufacturers who have not updated their quality systems risk:

- **483 Observations** citing non-conformities against ISO 13485 clauses
- **Warning Letters** for systemic quality system deficiencies
- **Import Alerts** for international manufacturers not meeting harmonized requirements
- **Delayed product clearances** due to quality system concerns

## 2. Key Differences: Legacy Part 820 vs. QMSR

### Documentation Requirements

| Area | Legacy Part 820 | QMSR (ISO 13485) |
|------|----------------|-------------------|
| Quality Manual | Not explicitly required | Required (Clause 4.2.2) |
| Quality Policy | Required (820.20) | Required with measurable objectives (Clause 5.3) |
| Process Approach | Implied | Explicit requirement (Clause 0.3) |
| Risk Management | Limited scope | Integrated throughout QMS (Clause 7.1) |
| Infrastructure | Implicit | Explicit requirements (Clause 6.3) |
| Work Environment | Implicit | Explicit contamination control (Clause 6.4) |

### Process-Based Approach

The most significant shift is from Part 820's prescriptive, subpart-based structure to ISO 13485's process-based approach. Manufacturers must now:

- Define quality system processes and their interactions
- Establish process inputs, outputs, and performance criteria
- Monitor and measure process effectiveness
- Apply risk-based thinking throughout the quality system

### Management Responsibility

ISO 13485 places greater emphasis on management commitment through:

- Documented quality policy with measurable quality objectives
- Management review with defined inputs and outputs
- Resource management including competency requirements
- Communication requirements across the organization

---

## 3. What This Means for Your Quality System

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **Gap Analysis**: Compare current Part 820 procedures against ISO 13485:2016 clause requirements
2. **Quality Manual**: Create or update a quality manual that describes QMS scope, processes, and interactions
3. **Process Documentation**: Map quality system processes with defined inputs, outputs, and metrics
4. **Risk Integration**: Embed risk-based decision making into all quality system processes
5. **Training**: Update personnel training to reflect ISO 13485 terminology and requirements

### Common Gaps Found in Part 820-Only Systems

- Missing or inadequate quality manual
- Insufficient process interaction documentation
- Limited risk management integration beyond design controls
- Inadequate infrastructure and work environment documentation
- Missing regulatory requirement determination processes (Clause 7.2.1)
- Insufficient customer communication procedures (Clause 7.2.3)

---

## 4. The ISO 13485:2016 Alignment Imperative

### For Domestic Manufacturers

US manufacturers who previously relied solely on Part 820 compliance must now align with ISO 13485:2016. This is not optional for QMSR compliance. Key alignment activities include:

- **Process Mapping**: Document all QMS processes and their sequence/interaction
- **Risk-Based Approach**: Apply ISO 14971 principles throughout the quality system, not just in design controls
- **Supplier Management**: Enhanced supplier evaluation and monitoring per Clause 7.4
- **Measurement, Analysis, and Improvement**: Formalized approaches to quality data analysis

### For International Manufacturers

Manufacturers already certified to ISO 13485:2016 are well-positioned but must still ensure:

- Compliance with retained FDA-specific requirements (complaint files, MDR reporting)
- 21 CFR Part 11 compliance for electronic records and signatures
- Alignment with FDA guidance documents referenced in the QMSR

---

## 5. 21 CFR Part 11 in a QMSR World

### Why Part 11 Is Your Clients' Gatekeeper

The QMSR does not replace 21 CFR Part 11. Any electronic records maintained as part of a manufacturer's quality system must still comply with Part 11 requirements:

- **Audit Trails**: System must capture who changed what, when, and why
- **Electronic Signatures**: Must be equivalent to handwritten signatures
- **Access Controls**: Role-based permissions with unique user identification
- **Data Integrity**: ALCOA+ principles (Attributable, Legible, Contemporaneous, Original, Accurate)
- **Record Retention**: Electronic records must be maintained and retrievable throughout their retention period

### Implications for QMS Software

Any software used within a manufacturer's quality system must support Part 11 compliance. This means:

- Immutable audit trails that cannot be modified or deleted
- Role-based access control with authentication
- Electronic signature capabilities
- Validated computer systems with documented evidence
- Data backup and disaster recovery procedures

---

## 6. Validation Requirements for QMS Software

### The Validation Burden

Under both the QMSR and 21 CFR Part 11, manufacturers must validate any software used in their quality system. This includes QMS platforms, document control systems, and compliance tracking tools.

### What Validation Entails

Software validation follows the GAMP 5 framework and requires:

#### Installation Qualification (IQ)
- Verification that the software is installed correctly
- Configuration matches documented specifications
- Infrastructure meets system requirements
- Version and dependency confirmation

#### Operational Qualification (OQ)
- Feature-level testing against requirements
- Verification that all functions operate as specified
- Boundary and error condition testing
- Security and access control verification

#### Performance Qualification (PQ)
- End-to-end process testing under realistic conditions
- Performance under expected load conditions
- Data integrity verification across workflows
- User acceptance testing

### How We Reduce Your Validation Burden

MedTech Compliance Suite ships with pre-written IQ/OQ/PQ validation kits. These include:

- Ready-to-execute test scripts for every platform feature
- Traceability matrices linking requirements to test cases
- Expected results documentation
- Report templates for validation summary

This saves clients weeks of validation effort and eliminates the risk of incomplete validation coverage.
